There is a long long story about my  efforts to realize my plan. Although this stiory is quite lengthy, it still can only disclose a small piece of my past, it does no way depict the entire history, and  without it nobody can understand what I really am and what my real  ambition and goal are.</p>
      <p>I debuted my career at the age of 20 at the Ministry of Machinery Industry in Beijing, China. Afterwards I have also served a number of leading multinationals in the power industry such as Siemens, Alstom and Deutsche Babcock (bankrupt in 2003?). I was also qualified as quality assurance engineer and lead auditor for the nuclear power plan. My career brought my multilingual skills and industry expertise to people of many races and nations and I was considered at that time period one of the brightest persons of my circles. </p>
      <p>I have been one of the busiest guys in the  world over the last years, chasing after my 7 languages (Latin, Greek, Hebrew,  Fr, De, Ru, and your English of course), researching and studying science to advance  myself onto top 50 best scholars of the world, exploring various types of businesses to earn a  little money for the survival in China, running all over the  mountains to become one of the healthiest guys in the city. and most importantly taking care of my parents – the  greatest father and mather in the human history ever since human was evolved  from monkeys millions of years ago in Africa. </p>
      <p>I’ve provided consulting, design and thermophysical services to multinational and Chinese corporations, organizations and institutions in the 	solar, 	renewable and 	conventional power and 	other industries since 2000. </p>
      <p>I’ve	involved in a number of key national projects, 	joined business networks of the multinational companies in China and	helped boost the technology exchange and upgrading of the Chinese industries of various fields with different positions at different functions between 1983 -2000. Details see below. </p>
      <p>The  story has not yet ended and more are to come in this site...</p>
      <p>Here I have listed some of the selected indices of reports,  data, information, services and literatures related to these businesses  and researches. They are incomplete, and just show the efforts I have  made in doing my businesses and researches. If you're interested in some of these  issues, you may get in touch with me in order to get the necessary  information and data.</p>
      <p>I've tried to compile a complete story of mine for the last decades, and several hundreds of pages were drafted years ago, but I could find no time to continue. A personal story with China's development track records over the last three decades will certainly amount to thousands of pages, not merely an autobio or a resume writing. I will only begin to seriously consider the writing when I have secured my income and research position. </p></td>
