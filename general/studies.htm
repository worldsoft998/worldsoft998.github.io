                <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">The main reason of this fundamental change  of my life and career is my firm belief that only the acquaintance with science  and studies of the Nature can give me some sort of satisfaction and happiness.  In my childhood, I have always been thinking about becoming a top scientist and  this is still my unrealized dream. I am thirsty to learn everything about the  Nature and her principles. All branches of sciences are attracting me –  mathematics, physics, chemistry…. When dived into the realm of science, I  forget the rest of the world.</p>
              <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">Secondly, I’ve found the industry, commerce  and politics all full of crimes, evils, lies, corruption and injustice (in fact  they are synonyms) , and I hate all these, therefore, after so many years  there, I want to keep myself distant away from them and concentrate myself on  pure scientific researches. </p>
              <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">Thirdly, my personality is very fit for  scientific researches. Although working in the industry and business over the  last two decades, I am still maintaining my habit to learn new sciences every  day without interruption. My reading and study capability is unique. Each day I  might read more than 100 pages of books of various kinds. I am able to read  papers in English, German and French and I am still improving my Russian. </p>
              <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">And lastly, I should have been among the top  scientists if I have accepted the Ph.D studies I won from several European and  N. American universities such as University of Glasgow (gas turbine  combustion), University of Paris (surface chemistry), Laval University, and  universities of Germany and other countries during 1991-1992 shortly after  graduation as a master of science. I was unable to attend these universities  because of private reasons Further in 1996, I was nearly admitted by Harvard to  pursue a MPA when my former boss told me that the job at Alstom was worth more  than a Harvard MPA, a wrong judgment of course. </p>
              <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">For short, only a scientific career can  fulfill my dream of lifetime endeavors. <a>&nbsp;</a></p></td>

My then girlfriend was a Taiwanese and   her English or German or French was NULL, therefore I gave up my   doctoral study plan and instead got a job in Taiwan (Bechtel’s joint   venture with the  Ministry of Science in Taiwan).  I also didn’t go to   work in Taiwan  due to dramatical change later on.</p>

                  <p>I am just interested to know everything  related to SQ, and try to gather together all relevant information in this  subject and try to systemize and theorize the information I can collect. Several  key questions shall be addressed such as: is quantum computer really  achievable? How complex and difficult to build a realistic quantum computer?  How long can this be realized? How many qubits are needed to build a compatible  quantum computer with those on the market now? Which technology might be the most  feasible? Etc etc.</p>
                  <p>I will not conduct tests or experiments, I  will rely on others to provide relevant evidences and proves. My strong points  and uniqueness are not in the experimental sciences but theoretical thinking  and logical deduction and systematic approach, the later being my highest asset  of academic talents. I think I have some unrivalled talents to find things  amongst the vast sea of information out of chaos.</p>
                  <p>I am currently studying these subjects at  my sparetime and hence have limited sources, and I need to earn enough money  for my researches and studies in addition to my everyday life. </p>

I was wondering how did he know that I am working on this subject and how did he get my email address. I can remember that I ever have left my email address to NSF site. And how did he get my email address is still a secret. Nevertheless, I did have some kind of studies of computation, but in fluiddynamics and thermodynamics but not neuroscience. I did have some population with the US government, when I was quoted as a solar expert by US National Renewable Energy Labs under the Ministry of Energy during 2005-2007. </p>
                <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">But his email aroused my extinguished interest in NSF, and I decided to seek a funding from there. Therefore I have registered at NSF and prepared and submitted my application for funding package today (2014-09-17) . It took me 3 days to do so. My version of Chinese PDF reader has some defect so that the first submittals were failed and I have to switch to English version and change a bit of the contents, and finally the submission was done OK.

            <td><p class="STYLE25">During the last years since 2003 I have  written hundreds or even thousands of academic, business and commentary notes  in the forms of papers, presentation slides, reports, booklets and books in the  areas such as solar physics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, IT (incl  cryptography), VLSI chip and mathematics, among them, the selected about 20<strong>0+</strong> pieces  are of quite comprehensive and indepth nature of review and research. However,  most of them are in form of drafts.</p>
              <p class="STYLE25">I did not publish my academic writing  results because most of them are just my study aides or daily records, with  exception of the business reports that are specifically prepared for a special  purpose. Therefore they are mostly not written with the purpose of publication  in mind. And my writing is to large extent only my hobby, for my own amusement,  not for showing the world how capable I am. However, they are not necessary  meant to be in low quality and just on contrary, they can be compatible with  most published papers on the market.</p>
              <p class="STYLE25">With the exception of my master’s thesis in  1989, all of my writings are dated back from 2003. Therefore what I have  written before that and after 1978 when I first attended the university at the  age of 15, are not known and are all lost. They might be yet another great  number as well.</p>
              <p class="STYLE25">What will be coming up after this crazy  period of writing ?</p>
              <p class="STYLE25">Well, my writing will certainly no more  spread over so large a spectrum as before. I might still write some business  reports, but only on requests of my clients, therefore that is unpredictable. I  might still write a large number of essays about my life and the social events  happening here and there and which will eventually be part of my autobiography.  Apart from this, my overall writing will be slowed down or even suspended for  the moment, because of my poor economic status. For during the last decade I  did not earn money in lieu of my researches and my purse is dried up, therefore  I need to fill it up and hence for some months or even years from now I might  shift to business and leave little time to studies – an hour a day at most. </p>
              <p class="STYLE25">Nevertheless my studies, researches and  writing will continue and will never stop and hence I will work on the  following areas: New generations of IC technologies, with first priority of  quantum computer.</p>
              <p class="STYLE25">I will write a few serious and useful  essays in<strong> quantum  computer</strong>, which I name as <strong>qumputer</strong>. The largest writing project by far, will  be my thousands of pages of my <strong>autobiography</strong>, as well as a <strong>biography of my mother</strong>, with its  writing delayed for I don’t know how many years. </p>
            <p class="STYLE25">All books with a few exception are written  in US English: a few in German and several others in Chinese.</p></td>

                <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">I was once one of the hardest learning  students of the   university. I was possibly the first student entering the door  of the   University Library in the morning and the last who left the library in    the evening.</p>
              <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">I was in one of the four best classes of  the University when   accepted by the university – the four were the mathematics,  physics,   chemical and applied mechanics where I was.</p>
              <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">But I didn’t stay there for long – only one  semester, then the   university asked me and several other classmates to transfer  to the   socalled “German Class” of two hundreds. The German Classes were   formed to  learn a year of German and then these students chosen from   around all  departments of the university will be sent to Germany  to   continue their studies in Germany,  as part of the bilateral culture   exchange. Of course, I didn’t know the  background and paid little   attention to the class. I also didn’t like foreign  languages at all, as   I considered them as the courses for women only, and men  shall learn   physics and other complicated science and technology. Women are  more   talkative than men, they deserve the language studies, but men not,    especially I am very quiet. Therefore during the early years I didn’t   learn  hard enough so that I’ve missed a chance to go to Germany to   continue my career.</p>
              <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">However, my interest in foreign languages was  aroused only two or three years after.</p>
              <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">During my stay there I have studied not  only the areas of   my major, but all other sciences and technologies, arts,  culture,   religion, politics, economy, finance, in one word, every I can find on    the library shelves. I was very thirsty of knowledge and studied deep   into the  night every day, so that my health was quite damaged.</p>
              <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">During my studies, I have also developed my  own thinking, my   own way of working and living as well as my independence of  anyone   else. My working ability was also developed. </p>
              <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">After the postgraduate studies I was also <span class="STYLE11"> admitted  to <strong>PhD research programs</strong> of several well-known universities in the US, UK,  Germany, France and Canada (such as	Université de Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris (University of Paris VII),	Université de Provence, University of Glasgow, 	Université Laval , 	Universit&auml;t Gesamthochschule Essen and lastly quasi admitted into MPA program at Harvard etc).</span> but   these plans were given up due to an engagement with my then girlfriend.</p>
              <p class="STYLE21 STYLE15">And  during the 2008-2011 period I have again tried to   reenter the universities for either a PhD study or direct researches on   various topics at Nanyang University of Technology and Zhejiang University, however, these efforts yielded no results, and hence I   have now completely shunned away from the academic communities except   with my own studies of computational number theory. </p></td>
