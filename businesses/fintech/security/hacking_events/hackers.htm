      <p>Stolen credentials are used to launch attacks which include the ability to stream live video of the screens of infected users.</p>
      <p>A previously unknown but highly organised hacking group is carrying out a series of cyber attacks against banks and financial institutions around the world, deploying trojan malware to gain entry into networks.</p>
      <p>The attackers are capable of monitoring everything a victim does in order to provide them with all the information they need to sneak around bank networks and make off with stolen funds.</p>
      <p>Uncovered by Kaspersky Lab, the 'Silence' hacking group is suspected to be a Russian-speaking operation which has hit at least 10 financial organisations including those in Armenia and Malaysia, but mostly within Russia.</p>
      <p>The initial attack techniques of Silence campaigns are similar threat actors including the infamous Carbanak group - initial victims are tricked by phishing emails which give the attackers a foothold into the network. They'll remain there for a long time, only striking when they have enough information to steal large amounts.</p>
      <p>Those behind Silence are appear to be actively targeting banks which have previously been attacked. They use emails from the addresses of real employees who have had accounts compromised - potentially bought from the dark web - to send a phishing email about what looks to be a routine request about opening a customer account.</p>
      <p>The message comes with a malicious attachment in the form of a 'Windows help . CHM' file which runs once the document has been opened. An embedded JavaScript within this automatically downloads and executes a Visual Basic script which then in turn downloads the a malware dropper from a command and control server.</p>
      <p>See also: Cyberwar: A guide to the frightening future of online conflict</p>
      <p>It's the Russian language in the code which has led researchers to the conclusion that the attack group is Russian-speaking.</p>
      <p>Once downloaded and installed on the system, the malware allows the attackers to take multiple screenshots of the victim's active screen, providing a real-time stream.</p>
      <p>A similar technique was used by Carbanak to gain an understanding of the victim's day-to-day activity and points to the ultimate end goal of Silence - obtaining all the information required to eventually steal money.</p>
      <p>The malware also includes a Winexecsvc tool which allows the execution of remote commands - useful when it comes to the attackers making their way around the infected network.</p>
      <p>Researchers note that this particular campaign has been successful in attacking financial institutions, no matter where in the world they're based or what the network infrastructure looks like.</p>
      <p>&quot;We have seen this trend growing recently, as more and more slick and professional APT-style cyber-robberies emerge and succeed. The most worrying thing here is that due to their in-the-shadow approach, these attacks may succeed regardless of the peculiarities of each bank's security architecture,&quot; said Sergey Lozhkin, security expert at Kaspersky Lab.</p>
      <p>While Silence uses very similar techniques to the Carbanak group - which has stolen more than $1 billion from banks worldwide - it's still uncertain if the two groups are at all related.</p>
      <p>Researchers have warned the the attacks are still ongoing.</p></td>
