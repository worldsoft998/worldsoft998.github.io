There are also some particular considerations when making such rankings, such as their fees, speedness of processing money transfer, easiness of registering and payment, availability of their payment interface, number of currencies and banks they support, languages they can handle, countries where they are operating, and of course reliability of their services. All these and others contribute to the final decision of the rankings.</td>
