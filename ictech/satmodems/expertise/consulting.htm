      <p>Angelia offers satellite broadband consulting and organizational development services in broadband systems, to organizations in industry.</p>
      <p>Satellite industry consulting services offered by Angelia address issues in the technical, operational, and business domains. We are particularly expert in assessing new technology and identifying how it may be inserted into systems that must achieve important objectives. The particular application areas of our focus include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Satellite technology and use -  ground segments</li>
        <li> Broadband and wireless communications</li>
        <li> Project development services for VSAT IT networks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Angelia has contributed strongly to the success of established technology developers, service providers, enterprises and startup ventures in these areas, including the following examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Design of national and regional satellite networks to deliver broadband Internet employing the DVB-S/S2/S2X standards</li>
        <li> Preliminary and detailed design of a global satellite communications network; </li>
        <li> Selection of appropriate satellite capacity; </li>
        <li> Definition of the ground segment; </li>
        <li> Selection of user terminals; </li>
        <li> Review and improvement of technical and management operations;</li>
        <li> Assessing and valuing new satellite and broadband communications technologies, such as Internet Protocol adaptation for wide area networking and use of frequencies above 10 GHz for broadband access and backbone services;</li>
        <li> Due diligence of a hardware manufacturer in the satellite microwave field.<br />
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For any business service provider who wants to enter into or expand the market of satellite broadband connections, it is not an easy task to undertake the business from an idea to  realization of profit generation. You need to decide some of the key issues before pouring in your money, such as those:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>which satellite operator(s) will you be cooperating with? (that also depends on the ground applications you're envisaging)</li>
        <li>what types of clients you will be serving - the whole world population, a continent, a big/medium/small country, a region, a city, a district, a community, an organization small or large, a building, a group or groups of few individuals spread over a certain area, etc etc. </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>afterwards you will be required to decide an optimal system layout design and configuration as well as the  technologies and systems/equipments/devices that suit your clients best, in terms of performance and costs. You shall also consider the installation, maintenance, repair, replace and upgrading requirements before the actual implementation of the project.</li>
      </ul>
