      <p>Lianshang has announced today that the company will launch its first satellite in 2019, and it is planned to provide free global satellite internet services by 2026 for the whole world.</p>
      <p>According to this plan, in 2019 the &quot;Lianshang No 1 Satellite&quot; shall be put into orbit, and by 2026, a socalled mixed orbit satellite constellation - the Lianshang Net Constellation - will be completed, and at that time the Internet connection for regions not yet covered is expected to be solved.</p>
      <p>The &quot;Lianshang Net Constellation&quot; will be composed of 272 satellites on low earth orbits and several data processing centers on earth. The Constellation will consist of two layers, the inner layer and the outer layer. The outer layer will be composed of 72 satellites at an altitude of 1000 km, while the inner layer has 200 satellites at an altitude of 600 km above the earth. </p>
      <p>According to Mr An Yang (安洋), Lianshang's chief scientist, the Lianshang project was founded in 2016, and the first satellite will be launched into orbit at Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in 2019 by the Long March Family of rockets, and in 2020 the company plans to launch 10 satellites into orbits.</p>
      <p>The Lianshang project team has an accumulated satellite research and development experiences of more than 15 years and has the capacity to develop about a hundred types of satellites. More than 50 satellites developed by Lianshang are currently on orbit.</p>
      <p>Sofar the world still has a population of 3.9 billion without Internet and in China this is 588 million. Satellite Internet brings them hope of some sort. Numerous companies are engaged in the last efforts to bring these people online, incl. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Oneweb and SpaceX.</p>
