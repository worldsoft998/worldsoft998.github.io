      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">China Aerospace Science &amp; Industry Corp (CASIC</span>) plans to launch 156 satellites in its &quot;Rainbow&quot; project. These satellites will be orbiting at 1000 km above the earth, covering the entire earth surface. This project is the first of its kind in China. The combination of small satellites at low orbits together with broadband services is just tackling the commercial demands in this area. </p>
      <p>According to  Bei Chao, deputy director of the General Aerospace Department of CASIC's No2 Institute, &quot;Rainbow&quot; will be a general satellite platform, just like a vehicle chassis. With this platform you can make a military vehicle, or a personal car, or a taxi, or whatsoever, provided that you shall have a chassis. Bei further explained that small satellites are easier for mass production and upgrading at low cost. He said further that low orbiting is able to avoid the information transmission latency, and helps to achieve the miniaturization of the user terminals. And at last the satellite communications frequency spectrum between 26.5 to 40 GHz will tremendously improve the network access rate. </p>
      <p>According to the plan, the Rainbow project will be undertaken in three steps. The first step was to launch an experimental satellite before 2018, to verify the key technologies in case of a single satellite. In the 2nd step 4 operational experimental satellites will be sent to orbits before end 2020, and a small constellation will be formed to enable users to experience the technologies; and at end 2025 all 156 satellites shall be put into operation in a network.</p>
      <p>Earlier CASIC has already  launched the &quot;Scorpio No 1&quot; satellite used for exploration of the three-phase Rainbow project. Along with the maturing of the technologies, this small platform is expected to finish its integration, testing, launch and applications. </p>
