      Design of Modem IP Cores - My Lifetime Mission<br>
      =================================================</p>
      <p>I'm now particularly specializing in design of modem and its IP cores. The modem IPs are designed for use in wireless and cable communications for home and professionals and will also be made available to industries, businesses, communities, governments and the defense in the near future.</p>
      <p>The IP cores can be incorporated into various terminals,  indoor and outdoor units and modems on the ground.</p>
      <p>Various communications technologies, modulation and demodulation technologies, coding technologies,  error correction codes,  VLSI technologies (FPGA, GPU, DSP, SDR, etc) are applied to make the design compatible with the latest chip technologies and its extensibility possible. HDL will be applied for the architectural and schematic design.</p>
      <p>I can also design modem IP cores for a vast scope of wireless RF and cable communications. I'm particularly focusing on satellite broadband Internet (Satnet)  modem IP cores design, for I foresee that the future broadband will all be based on satellite technologies. For this purpose I am developing a web portal called &quot;Angelia Modem&quot;  for this part of the technology.</p>
      <p>My lifetime mission is to design the best modem ICs in the industry across the world.<br>
