    <td><p>The modulator and the demodulator each have  4 possible sources for their bit rate timing.</p>
        <p> The modulator always outputs the Send  Timing signal, but the source of this timing may be either:</p>
        <p> 1. An internally generated bit rate NCO  locked to the internal reference,<br>
        2. The Demodulator Receive Clock,<br>
        3. An external input at the data rate or<br>
        4. An external input on the Interface  Terminal Timing input.</p>
      <p> The modem’s internal reference is a 2.0  parts per million clock oscillator, which is sufficiently
        accurate for most applications. If system  timing requirements dictate a better reference, the internal
        oscillator may be phase locked to an  external reference applied at the rear panel.</p>
      <p> The demodulator always outputs the Receive  Timing signal. The Receive Demodulator Clock derived
        from the receive signal is synchronous with  the Receive Data and is the normal source of the
        receive timing. If the system requires a  different clock (which still must be the same average rate as
        the demodulator’s receive clock) then  provisions are made to buffer the data in a programmable
        FIFO. The demodulator receive clock is  always used to clock the data into the FIFO. The clock
        output can be either:</p>
      <p> 1. The Demodulator Receive Clock,<br>
        2. The Modulator Clock<br>
        3. An internally generated bit rate NCO locked  to the Internal Reference, or<br>
        4. An external FIFO Clock applied on the  interface connector.</p>
      <p> If the demodulator receive clock is  selected then the FIFO itself is physically bypassed by switching
        circuitry.</p>
      <p> The internally generated bit rate NCO  locked to the Internal Reference oscillator is settable to 40 bit
        accuracy. That is 1 part in 10 to the 12 or  1 part per trillion.</p>
      <p> A block diagram simplified representation  of the Transmit and Receive clock sources are shown </p>

      <p align="center"><img src="ReceiveClockSources.png" width="1063" height="651"></p>
      <p align="center">Receive Clock  Sources</p>
      <p> These Clock  sources may be used in various ways in a system implementation to provide  correct
        timing at a  destination. Each of the clock sources can be set either from the front panel  or from an
        external monitor  and control system.</p></td>
