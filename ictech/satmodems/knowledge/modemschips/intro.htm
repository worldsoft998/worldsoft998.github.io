    <td><p>A satellite  modem or satmodem is a modem used to establish data transfers using a  communications satellite as a relay. The satellite modem's main function is to transform  an input bitstream to a radio signal and vice versa.</p>
      <p>There are  some devices that include only a demodulator (and no modulator, thus only  allowing data to be downloaded by satellite) that are also referred to as  &quot;satellite modems.&quot; These devices are used in satellite Internet  access (in this case uploaded data is transferred through a conventional PSTN  modem or an ADSL modem).</p>
      <p>A satellite  modem is not the only device needed to establish a communication channel. Other  equipment that are essential for creating a satellite link include satellite  antennas and frequency converters.</p>
      <p>Data to be  transmitted are transferred to a modem from data terminal equipment (e.g. a  computer). The modem usually has Intermediate Frequency (IF) output (that is,  50-200 MHz), however, sometimes the signal is modulated directly to L-band. In  most cases frequency has to be converted using an upconverter before  amplification and transmission.</p>
      <p>A modulated  signal is a sequence of symbols, pieces of data represented by a corresponding  signal state, e.g. a bit or a few bits, depending upon the modulation scheme  being used. Recovering a symbol clock (making a local symbol clock generator  synchronous with the remote one) is one of the most important tasks of a demodulator.</p>
      <p>Similarly,  a signal received from a satellite is firstly downconverted (this is done by a  low-noise block converter - LNB), then demodulated by a modem, and at last  handled by data terminal equipment. The LNB is usually powered by the modem through  the signal cable with 13 or 18 V DC.</p>
      <p><strong>Features</strong></p>
      <p>The main  functions of a satellite modem are modulation and demodulation. Satellite  communication standards also define error correction codes and framing formats.</p>
      <p><strong>Popular  modulation types</strong> being used for satellite communications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Binary phase shift keying (BPSK);</li>
        <li>          Quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK);</li>
        <li>          Offset quadrature phase shift keying  (OQPSK);</li>
        <li>          8PSK;</li>
        <li>          Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM),  especially 16QAM.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The popular  satellite error correction codes</strong> include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Convolutional codes:
          <ul>
            <li> with constraint length less than 10,  usually decoded using a Viterbi algorithm</li>
            <li> with constraint length more than 10,  usually decoded using a Fano algorithm</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>          Reed-Solomon codes usually concatenated  with convolutional codes with an interleaving</li>
        <li>          New modems support superior error correction  codes (turbo codes and LDPC codes)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Frame formats</strong> that are supported by various  satellite modems include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Intelsat business service (IBS) framing</li>
        <li>          Intermediate data rate (IDR) framing</li>
        <li>          MPEG-2 transport framing (used in DVB)</li>
        <li>          E1  and T1 framing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>High-end modems also incorporate some  <strong>additional features</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple data interfaces (like RS-232, RS-422, V.35, G.703, LVDS,  Ethernet);</li>
        <li>          Embedded Distant-end Monitor and Control (EDMAC), allowing to control  the distant-end modem;</li>
        <li>          Automatic Uplink Power Control (AUPC), that is, adjusting the output  power to maintain a constant signal to noise ratio at the remote end;</li>
        <li>          Drop  and insert feature for a multiplexed stream, allowing to replace some channels  in it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Functions</strong></p>
      <p>Satellite modems are often used for home  internet access.</p>
      <p>There are two different types, both employing  the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standard as their basis:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>  One-way satmodems (DVB-IP modems) use a return channel not based on  communication with the satellite, such as telephone or cable.</li>
        <li>          Two-way satmodems (DVB-RCS modems, also called astromodems) employ a  satellite-based return channel as well; they do not need another connection.  DVB-RCS is ETSI standard EN 301 790.</li>
      </ul>      
      <p>There are also industrial satellite modems  intended to provide a permanent link. They are used, for example, in the Steel  shankar network.</p>
      <p><strong>How to choose a satellite modem?</strong></p>
      <p>When it comes to satellite modems, there is a broad range to choose from. They range from very inexpensive satellite modems to obtain home Internet access to costly multipurpose modem devices and machinery for commercial use. The word modem means modulator or demodulator. Satellite modems transform and receive an input bit stream to a radio signal. However, some satellite modem devices only have a demodulator that is used to access satellite Internet, whereas data is transferred in other directions via the use of a conventional PSTN model or an ADSL modem.</p>
      <p><strong> What is the best modem for satellite internet? </strong></p>
      <p>The best modem for satellite internet is the one you get from your provider because it will already be calibrated to the satellite signal you’re receiving. However, you might want to use a faster or more powerful router than the one that comes built in to the modems offered by the ISPs. Currently, the only companies offering satellite internet are HughesNet and Viasat. Both providers lease modems with built-in Wi-Fi routers to their customers. The modems from both ISPs have similar specs, but Viasat gives you more ports and security options. HughesNet uses the HT2000W satellite modem, while Viasat doesn’t list the exact model number you’ll get. </p>

      <h3><u>WiFi  Gateway</u></h3>
    <p>The modem takes care of translating IP  packets into a format compatible with transmission over a satellite link. Its ouput  is a modulated carrier wave in the L band (950-1450 MHz). Earlier   DVB (Digital Video Broadcast) modulation was used, the  same type of coding used for satellite TV. It had the advantage of already  being widely deployed, so the hardware was already relatively cheap. New  advances in technology made it economical to use WIMAX (Worldwide Interpretable  Microwave Access) , and IPoS  (Internet Protocol over Satellite).</p></td>
