    <td><p>A <strong>multiplexer</strong> transforms several digital streams  into one stream. This is often referred to as 'Muxing.'</p>
    Multiplexer is a device that has multiple inputs and a single line output. The select lines determine which input is connected to the output, and also to increase the amount of data that can be sent over a network within certain time. It is also called a data selector.</td>

    <td><p>Generally, a <strong>demultiplexer</strong> is a device which  transforms one multiplexed data stream to several streams which it consists of.   It is used to send a signal to one of the many devices. Satellite modem doesn't have so many outputs, so a demultiplexer here performs  a drop operation, allowing to choose channels that will be transferred to  output.</p>
      <p>A demultiplexer achieves this goal by  maintaining frame synchronization.</p>
    <p>The main <strong>difference</strong> between a multiplexer and a de-multiplexer is that a multiplexer takes two or more signals and encodes them on a wire, whereas a de-multiplexer does reverse to what the multiplexer does.</p></td>
