          <td><h2>What is Satellite Internet?</h2>
            <p>If you live or work out in the middle of nowhere then you’ll have few internet connection options. One of those options is dialup, and the second is usually satellite.</p>
            <p>Satellite internet is a wireless connection that involves 3 satellite dishes; one at the internet service providers hub, one in space and one attached to your property. In addition to the satellite dish you also need a modem and cables running to and from the dish to your modem.</p>
            <p>Once you have everything connected, the ISP will send the internet signal to the dish in space which then relays it to you. Every time you make a request (new page, download, send an email, etc) it goes to the dish in space and then to the (ISP’s) hub. The completed request is then sent back through space, to your dish and then to your computer.</p>
            <h2>Why Use Satellite Internet?</h2>
            <p>The only reason why you might use satellite internet is if you live in an area where other internet options such as cable or DSL isn’t available. If you’re on dialup then satellite internet will be an “upgrade” in the sense that satellite internet is considerably faster.</p>
            <p>Other than that, though, there isn’t much of a reason to use satellite internet. Look at these pros/cons and you’ll see what I mean. </p>
            <h2>Satellite Internet Pros</h2>
            <p> Satellite internet is faster than dialup. It’ll depend on what package you buy, but you can expect satellite speeds to be 10x to 35x times faster than dialup.</p>
            <p> Satellite internet connections can handle high bandwidth usage, so your internet speed/quality shouldn’t be affected by lots of users or “peak use times.”</p>
            <p> You don’t need a phone line for satellite internet.</p>
            <p>As you can see, the cons of satellite internet (far) outweigh any pros. It’s not the greatest or most reliable option, and it’s incredibly expensive. Some of the cost may be due to the technology, but it’s also a supply and demand thing. There isn’t much (internet) supply in the middle of nowhere, so the demand (and costs) are going to be high to reflect this.</p>
            <p>That being said, it’s hard to complain about or knock satellite internet when it’s really the only option you have (if you have other options such as DSL or cable, you should choose one of those instead). It is faster than dialup, and it’ll provide internet access to areas that the other connections won’t. The bottom line — it’s better than not having internet access at all.</p>
            <h2>Satellite Internet Cons</h2>
            <p> Satellite connections can often be disrupted by extreme weather conditions.The weather affects the signal path. During bad wind or rain storms you should expect poor quality internet, assuming you have internet at all.</p>
            <p> Poor latency or high ping rate. Latency and ping rate are essentially the same thing; they both test how long it takes to communicate between another computer, device, service or server in a network.</p>
            <p>In the case of satellite internet, it’s how fast you send and receive files (the delay or how much lag there is). Since you have to send data to space, to your ISP and back again, satellite internet has poor latency, or a high ping rate. So satellite internet is not good for you if you’re a gamer or if you intend to use VoIP services.</p>
            <p> Minor obstructions can affect your signal. Your dish need to point south (where all the orbiting dishes are), and anything in the way of your dish’s signal such as branches or buildings can affect the quality. This can be a major pain if you live out in the woods.</p>
            <p> Bandwidth limitations. Each month you’ll have so much bandwidth you can use up before your ISP throttles your connections (slows it down). This is in accordance to their (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptable_use_policy) Fair Use Policy. Some ISPs do daily bandwidths instead, which is slightly better, as you don’t have to wait as long as an entire month if you use up your bandwidth right away.</p>
            <p> VPNs aren’t compatible with satellite internet. They require a low latency, high bandwidth setup which is the complete opposite of what you’ll get with satellite internet.</p>
            <p>Satellite speeds are not as fast as ADSL2+ or Cable broadband connections and speed will vary depending on the amount of data being transmitted by the satellite at the time of connection. Generally, satellite broadband speed range up to about 800kbps for downloads and up to 128kbps for uploads. This is less than the average ADSL broadband connections, but over ten times faster than a dial up internet connection.</p>
            <p>Satellite Broadband connections require a professional installation of a receiver which is installed on the roof of your house or in the line of sight of a satellite network. You will also need a broadband modem to decode the satellite connection once it is received.  Because installation requires a technician, set up fees for satellite broadband are generally fairly expensive.</p>
            <p>Satellite Broadband can be expensive and if you are able to receive an ADSL, Cable or Mobile broadband connection it is generally a better option. You’ll pay around $100 per month for speeds of 2 Mbps. To put this into perspective, this is twice what you pay per month for 25x faster cable internet.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Technologies</h2>
            <p>There are numerous technologies,  applications and topologies for satellite Internet, such:</p>
            <p>--With regards to satellite technologies,  we have geostationary orbiting, low orbiting satellites, and satellites  operating at different frequencies</p>
            <p>--As far as topologies are concerned, we  have hub systems, star systems and other sophisticated systems on the ground,  and finally </p>
            <p>--There are numerous different application  circumstances which require different complexities of technologies such as  military grade, governmental use, commercial and enterprise use, business and  professional as well as residential applications, all require their own  technologies and configurations.</p>
            <p>Satellite subscribes can choose from two types of connections: one way or two way broadband connections. A one way connection enables the user to download information from the internet but will not send information back to the satellite. This means on a one way connection the user cannot upload information back onto the internet, for example by sending an email or uploading a photo. One way connections are useful if the user only requires access to view information on the internet. A two way connection enables the satellite broadband subscriber to upload and download information to and from the internet.</p>
            <p>In one word, it is not possible to define a  single use instance for our design, therefore we would not try to cover these  topics here in our first attempt.</p>
            <p>As such, we would start with the simplest,  but also most common use of the satellite broadband internet, at least in the  near future, that it the residential and to some lesser degree, professional or  personal applications. These two are sometimes identical, but you may still  make some visible differences, depending how do you define a professional and  how this professional will be using his Internet via satellite
