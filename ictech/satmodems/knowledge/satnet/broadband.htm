        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">The indoor modem connected to your computer:</span> A satellite <u>modem</u> facilitates data transfers using a communications satellite as a relay. </p>
      <p> The satellite Internet modem supplied is connected directly to your laptop or PC with an <br>
        Ethernet cable. Another option that you have is to purchase 
        a wireless <strong>router</strong> and connect it to your  modem. This lets you create an in-home network that 
        will let you connect various  Internet-enabled devices, such as computers, smartphones, 
        gaming consoles and tablets to the Internet  service.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">A satellite dish – usually installed  outdoors, often on top of your roof</p>
      <p> The satellite dish that gets installed  receives and transmits signals with the internet provider's <br>
        satellite. It is approximately the same  size as most dishes used for satellite TV. The small<br>
        satellite dish can be mounted in various  locations such as on your roof, on a pole or on <br>
        the side of your home. VSAT units are two-way satellite ground stations with <u>dishes</u> that typically range from 0.75m to 1.8m in diameter. VSAT Systems offers VSAT  antennas between 1.2m and 2.4m in diameter, depending on the application and  location.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">The teleports: </p>
      <p>The <u>teleport</u> is the  earth station that controls communications across the space link. The teleport  is the heart of the VSAT Systems satellite Internet system. </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">The Network Operations Center (NOC): </p>
      <p>The  facility which controls all communications over the satellite link. The <u>NOC</u> monitors for power failures, satellite signal issues and other performance  issues that may affect the network. </p>
      <h2>2 A geostationary satellite up in space</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">The satellite: </p>
      <p><br>
        The satellite is responsible for relaying  signals that come from your home to the satellite internet <br>
        provider's gateways. The satellite also  transmits signals from the gateway to your home. 
        The satellite takes advantage of the latest  in spot beam technology to offer faster speeds 
        and more reliable service. </p>
      <p>In a geostationary or  geosynchronous orbit 22,236 miles above the earth’s surface, a satellite  completes one revolution in exactly the same amount of time that it takes the  Earth to rotate one full turn on its axis. Thus, the satellite always appears  at the same position above the Earth. This eliminates the need for satellite  dishes at the user location to track the satellite, which greatly simplifies  their construction and cost. These satellites, used for a variety of purposes  like broacast and telecommunications, can also be used to provide Internet  access at any location on Earth.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold"> Transponder space segment: </p>
      <p>The  communications channels on a satellite that both receive and retransmit data.  Modern satellites carry between 36 and 72 separate transponders all running at  different frequencies. These frequency segments are used for transmission of  data. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>3. Gateways</h2>
      <p> Satellite internet providers have gateways  in various locations 
        which enable transmission of information  between the Internet, 
        the satellite and your home.</p>
      <p>A satellite gateway (also referred to as a teleport or hub) is a ground station that transmits data to/from the satellite to the local area network. It houses the antennas and equipment that convert the Radio Frequency (RF) signal to an Internet Protocol (IP) signal for terrestrial connectivity. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>4. The Internet</h2>
      <p style="font-weight: bold"> Internet Backbone: </p>
      <p>The backbone is a large  collection of interconnected, high-capacity, commercial, government, and  academic data routes and core routers that carry data. They connect with other  countries and continents around the world. </p>
      <p>Anything that you could access on the  Internet through a wired connection will 
        be available as well when you use the  satellite Internet service. This means 
        you can browse the web at high speeds,  watch videos, download music, connect
        to  your friends and family through video chat and a whole lot more.</p>
      <h2>5. How the system works?</h2>
      <p>To provide rural and remote residents with broadband  Internet access, satellite Internet providers spend millions of dollars to put  high capacity satellites in space. On your end, the satellite internet provider  will supply you with a modem and a small satellite dish which is around the  same size as a standard satellite TV dish. Everything gets setup by certified  installers that install and configure the service at your home... they don't  leave until your Internet is working and has been tested for giving you blazing  download speeds that match your Internet plan.</p>
      <p>And afterwards your computer is connected to your  network, which in turn is connected to the Internet by VSAT Systems. You open a  web browser, and type in a web address. 
        When you send a request from your computer,  through your home network,   your      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">indoor satellite modem (1)</span> will  modulate the  signal and send that request to the </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">satellite dish (2)</span> on your  rooftop,  converting this signal to an  RF signal and sending it to the </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">satellite (3) </span>orbiting up in space. It is  important to understand that while satellite internet service uses an orbiting  satellite, it (the satellite) is in fact constantly maintains a relatively  fixed location; which makes it predictable for communication requests to be  sent and received to/from it. The orbiting satellite passes a signal,  containing your request, to your </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">service provider’s communication hub (4). </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">The  requisite data (5) </span>- website, email, product details etc. – is retrieved, and  it makes its way back to your computer via the same route it took when you made  the request. &nbsp;
        The whole cycle is then reversed and the  requested data is available to the user. </p>
      <p> You may think that, with satellite signals  travelling all the way into the atmosphere, and then bouncing off dish antennas  and hubs, internet access might take an eternity. You’re wrong. It takes  seconds for messages to go back and forth between various components – and it’s  hardly noticeable! </p></td>
