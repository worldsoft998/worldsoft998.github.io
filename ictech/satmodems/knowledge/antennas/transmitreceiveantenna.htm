    <td><h2><a>The “transmit  and receive integrated assembly” (or “TRIA”)</a></h2>
        <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmit_and_receive_integrated_assembly</p>
      <p>A transmit and receive integrated assembly (TRIA) is used on a two-way satellite dish to process signals to and from a ground-based system and an earth-orbiting satellite. The TRIA is the part of the antenna which contains both the feed horn and the circuits which convert high-frequency satellite signals such as X-band, Ku-band and Ka-band to and from the L-band microwave signals used for transmission between the dish and the customer-premises equipment. </p>
      <p><strong>The TRIA is comprised of a  Ku band transmit BUC and a universal LNB (PLL LO switchable).</strong></p>
      <p>The  transmit-receive integrated assembly comprises a Ku band transmitter block up converter (BUC) and a low phase noise PLL LNB with switched local oscillator frequencies and integrated ortho-mode transducer (OMT) and filters which separate the horizontal and vertical polarisations and the transmit and receive frequencies.</p>
      <p>It combines all discrete components ( OMT, waveguides and transmit reject filter and LNB) into one neat compact assembly. A key advantage is that you don’t need to pre-choose the type of LNB. In this case a multi-frequency LO universal LNB is offered with multiple local oscillator frequencies, switchable using an external dongle that fits to the LNB cable next to the modem and which allows the LNB LO frequency and co-pol or cross-pol operation to be selected using DIL switches.Transmit 14 to 14.5 GHz. and Receive 10.7 to 12.75 GHz.Co-pol or x-pol operation.</p>
      <p>The low phase noise PLL type LNB uses phase lock loop technology, making this ideal for narrow band SCPC as well as advanced modulation techniques 8-PSK, 8-QAM and 16-QAM which make more efficient use for the satellite bandwidth and so potentially reduce monthly costs by 2/3 or 1/2 of present costs.</p>
      <p>It is ideal for DVB-S2 when operating at the highest order modulation methods.</p>
      <p><strong>Transmit frequency:</strong></p>
      <p>The satellite uplink frequency is in the range 14 – 14.5 GHz. The BUC up converter frequency is 13.05 GHz so your modem transmit frequency needs to be in the range is in the 950 to 1450 MHz.</p>
      <p><strong>Receive frequency:</strong></p>
      <p>The PLL LNB has multiple alternative local oscillator conversion frequencies which may be selected using an external dongle located in the LNB cable next to the indoor modem. DIL switches allow selection of the appropriate LNB local oscillator frequency to match your VSAT modem receive range to the ITU regional spectrum to which your satellite is operating. Cross-pol operation and co-pol operation may be selected also.</p>
      <p>The TRIA comes with a set of adaptors for Andrew, Prodelin, Patriot feed horns etc.</p>
      <p>The TRIA comes with external dongles (to be connected in the LNB cable and  the other to the BUC cable near the indoor modem) to allow the multiple alternative LNB LO frequencies to be selected and to enable polarisation switching (selection of cross pole or co-pole operation).</p>
