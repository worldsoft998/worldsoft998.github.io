    <td><p align="left">Unless you only have one computer and it’s in the same room as your modem, chances are you may be interested in using a router. A router allows a satellite Internet connection to be shared by multiple computers. Your router turns your internet connection into your home network. Your wireless router allows you to connect several computers to a single network without the need for an Ethernet cable connection. It also allows for mobile connections within the signal range. If you want a wireless network, make sure your router has Wi-Fi capability. Often your modem will contain a built-in router so you don’t need to worry about another piece of equipment.</p>    </td>

    <td><p><em>Wireless or Wired </em></p>
    <p>A standard router requires a physical connection between all computers on the network and the Internet connection. Many wires have to be run to accomplish this. Wireless routers allow the network to function without any wires run to computers or other wireless devices. A physical connection between the router and the satellite Internet connection's modem is all that is required for a wireless router to function. </p>
    <p><em>Protocol</em></p>
    <p> Wireless routers use three types of protocol for transferring data on the network. Wireless-N is the fastest and is backward compatible with all other protocols. Wireless-G is not as fast, but if the network consists of mostly older devices, it may be more than adequate. Wireless-B was the first wireless protocol. Both the G and N versions can support Wireless-B devices. </p>
    <p><em>Frequency Band </em></p>
    <p>As wireless networks become more common, frequency bands are beginning to get overcrowded. Some routers offer dual-band features that allow the user to choose between two different frequency bands to run their home network on. This is something to consider if there are a lot of wireless networks nearby, such as in a busy office building, or many electronic devices that might interfere with wireless transmissions. </p></td>

    <td><p><strong>Which Features Should Satellite Internet Router Have?</strong></p>
    <p> It doesn’t matter if you are buying a router for HughesNet, ViaSat, or EarthLink, because these providers get you a modem that can be connected to almost any wireless router. There are more important things on your router then just maximal combined speeds. Features we explain below are critical if you want a smooth and stable connection on every device connected to your home Wi-Fi network.</p>
    <p><em>Quality of Service (QoS) </em></p>
    <p> A tool allowing your router to set priorities for certain devices or types of traffic. In other words, your TV streaming or online gaming will not freeze and stutter because somebody is downloading files, watching Netflix on another laptop or is web browsing in your home at the same time. </p>
    <p><em>MU-MIMO (Multiple-In, Multiple-Out) –</em></p>
    <p>This technology allows a WiFi router to communicate with multiple devices simultaneously which has a noticeable impact on everyday Wi-Fi. It makes networks much more efficient. </p>
    <p><em>Beamforming</em></p>
    <p> In short, beamforming is all about focusing a Wi-Fi signal in a specific direction. It provides a faster, stronger Wi-Fi signal with longer range for each device. With this feature, each device you connect to your home network will get a better Wi-Fi signal and reception. </p></td>

    <td><p>The best router for satellite internet depends on what you want. While you must use the modem issued by your satellite internet provider, you can use any router you choose. This opens up a lot of options. Using an alternate router might enhance your network’s performance, but if you’d rather not mess with it, the modems you get with <strong>HughesNet</strong> or <strong>Viasat</strong> both come with built-in Wi-Fi routers.</p>
      <p><strong>TP-Link</strong></p>
    <p>For a router that delivers plenty of performance at a reasonable price, go with the TP-Link Archer AC1750 Smart Wi-Fi Router. </p>
    <p><strong>NETGEAR</strong></p>
    <p>If you want a high-end router because you like having all the best stuff, we suggest the NETGEAR Nighthawk X10. The fast, dual-band connection will keep your home network humming. However, this router is expensive and is way faster than most satellite internet services, so it’s probably overkill for most people.</p>
    <p><strong>Linksys</strong></p>
    <p>Linksys has a well-respected line of routers offered at affordable prices – around fifty dollars for the most basic and around one hundred fifty dollars for a higher quality router. Linksys routers have received great reviews for speed and strength of connection, and some users have also commented on the quality of the design, in that Linksys has switched to slimmer routers without the cumbersome antennas that are attached to older models. Durability is also key to Linksys routers; users have expressed satisfaction with the fact that their Linksys routers have lasted for years, as opposed to other brands, which often break down in a matter of months. Linksys makes installation incredibly easy, even for those without much experience setting up wireless networks, and the ease of encryption allows you to secure your connection without a hassle.</p>
    <p><strong>Apple</strong></p>
    <p>Apple's line of extremely popular electronics happens to include wireless routers. The Apple AirPort costs around one hundred seventy-five dollars on average and works for both all-Mac networks and networks with a mix of Mac and PC devices. The AirPort is relatively easy to set up, and it offers many bonuses in addition to reliability and range. The router has built-in features for external hard drive and printer sharing as well as guest networking, which allows you to grant access to friends without revealing your wireless password. Some users believe that an Apple router may not be optimal if you are operating a network devoid of Apple devices, but the AirPort is widely regarded as the best router for networks involving Macs.</p>
    <p><strong>D-Link </strong></p>
    <p>D-Link offers a series of routers that are easy to use and effective. Routers range in price from around fifty dollars all the way up to three hundred dollars. Consumers have found success with the range of the wireless signal as well as the router's ability to handle traffic from multiple computers, both wired and wireless. D-link's routers come with a detailed manual that makes setting up and troubleshooting especially easy. Users have also commented on the manageable size and versatile shape of the router, which allows it to take up minimal space in your home or office. Not only are the routers effective, but the company also pays attention to the environment; the routers come in recyclable packaging and the power adapter has earned Energy Star status, meaning it meets stringent EPA energy efficiency guidelines.</p></td>

    <td><p> You should position your router as close to the center of your network as possible. A router sends its Wi-Fi signal in all directions, so centralizing it maximizes the signal strength to the widest area. Also, avoid placing your router on or near metal objects like filing cabinets or safes. Metal can interfere with the signal. </p></td>

    <td><strong>How to Use Wireless Routers with Satellite Internet</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p></p>
      <p>Step 1</p>
      <p>Connect your satellite modem to the router with an Ethernet patch cable.</p>
      <p><br>
        Step 2</p>
      <p>Turn on your router. Allow it to complete the boot process. A new router will self-configure and automatically attach to the satellite modem. If you are connecting a router that has been used previously, press and hold the reset button for at least 30 seconds to return the router to its default, or factory, settings.</p>
      <p><br>
        Step 3</p>
      <p>Connect the router to your computer with an Ethernet patch cable. Insert one end of the cable into an Ethernet port on your router. Insert the other end into your computer's networking port.</p>
      <p><br>
        Step 4</p>
      <p>Set your network card to accept DHCP. This allows your computer to automatically obtain an IP address from the router.</p>
      <p><br>
        Step 5</p>
      <p>Open your browser. Enter the router's IP address into the browser's address bar and press the &quot;Enter&quot; key. Most home network routers use 192.168.1.1 as a default address. Consult your product documentation if this address doesn't work.</p>
      <p><br>
        Step 6</p>
      <p>Enter the default user name and password when prompted by the router's user interface. You will be able to find these in your documentation as well as on the manufacturer's website.</p>
      <p><br>
        Step 7</p>
      <p>Click on the &quot;Wireless&quot; tab on the main page of the router's user interface screen.</p>
      <p><br>
        Step 8</p>
      <p>Change the SSID name from the factory default to any name you wish. Then select &quot;disable&quot; on the SSID wireless broadcast option. A user needs to know the SSID to connect to a wireless network. Default names are easy to guess, especially for common brands of routers. By changing the name and disabling the name broadcast, most casual hackers will be discouraged and move on to easier targets.</p>
      <p><br>
        Step 9</p>
      <p>Click on the &quot;Wireless Security&quot; tab. You will be given the option to turn on several different security keys. Refer to your router's manual to determine which, if any, you wish to use.</p>
      <p><br>
        Step 10</p>
      <p>Click on &quot;Wireless MAC Filter.&quot; This setting allows you to determine which computers are allowed to access your wireless network by MAC address. The MAC address is an address that is unique for each computer. If you have three or four computers that regularly access your network, this may be the easiest and most secure method to use.</p></td>
