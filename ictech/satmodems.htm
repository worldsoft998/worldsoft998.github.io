Thanks to Elon Musk and many others in developing the technologies with huge investment. I don't have money to launch a single satellite, but I have good expertise to offer you and others in configuing an optimal solution for your satellite modulation and demodulation technology.

    <td><p>Angelia offers satellite broadband consulting and organizational development services in broadband systems, to organizations in industry.</p>
      <p>Satellite industry consulting services offered by Angelia address issues in the technical, operational, and business domains. We are particularly expert in assessing new technology and identifying how it may be inserted into systems that must achieve important objectives. The particular application areas of our focus include:</p>
      <p> Satellite technology and use -  ground segments<br />
        Broadband and wireless communications<br />
        Project development services for VSAT IT networks</p>
      <p>Angelia has contributed strongly to the success of established technology developers, service providers, enterprises and startup ventures in these areas, including the following examples:</p>
      <p> Design of national and regional satellite networks to deliver broadband Internet employing the DVB-S/S2/S2X standards<br />
        Preliminary and detailed design of a global satellite communications network; <br />
        Selection of appropriate satellite capacity; <br />
        Definition of the ground segment; <br />
        Selection of user terminals; <br />
        Review and improvement of technical and management operations;<br />
        Assessing and valuing new satellite and broadband communications technologies, such as Internet Protocol adaptation for wide area networking and use of frequencies above 10 GHz for broadband access and backbone services;<br />
        Due diligence of a hardware manufacturer in the satellite microwave field.</p>
      <p>For any business service provider who wants to enter into or expand the market of satellite broadband connections, it is not an easy task to undertake the business from an idea to realization of profit generation. You need to decide some of the key issues before pouring in your money, such as those:</p>
      <p>which satellite operator(s) will you be cooperating with? (that also depends on the ground applications you're envisaging)</p>
      <p>what types of clients you will be serving - the whole world population, a continent, a big/medium/small country, a region, a city, a district, a community, an organization small or large, a building, a group or groups of few individuals spread over a certain area, etc etc. </p>
      <p>Afterwards you will be required to decide an optimal system layout design and configuration as well as the technologies and systems/equipments/devices that suit your clients best, in terms of performance and costs. You shall also consider the installation, maintenance, repair, replace and upgrading requirements before the actual implementation of the project.</p>
      <p>We're just the right company for your above needs. Our long time experiences in the design of modem for satellite broadband have enabled us to understand all the details of the business chains, from satellite operators, down to ground equipment vendors, solution and operation providers.  Rely on us for your complete solution of a viable satellite broadband connection.</p></td>

    <td><p>Angelia offers China Satellite Broadband Monthly (CSBM) Reports to companies and organizations in industry worldwide.</p>
      <p>The English language CSBM reports are dedicated to international satellite broadband communities who want to have a first hand research and analysis about the Chinese satellite broadband industry and market on timely basis. This report is the only one of that kind available to international satellite broadband businesses, and covers key development areas such as (fundamental) research, development and design technology, manufacturers, operators, solution, engineering and marketing service providers, market, investment as well as key government policy, plans and programs in mainland China (excl. H.K. and Taiwan, ROC). This report was initiated as a result of our own studies of the satellite broadband technologies and industry, along with our fundamental researches (wireless and satellite communications, modulation and demodulation, information theory and signal processing etc) in the satellite broadband design and manufacturing in collaboration with research institutes and universities in China and other countries. The report was started upon the requests of our clients over the years. We also need these compilations for our own researches and development.</p>
      <p>The CSBM reports are prepared by the first class industry insiders, therefore we can assure you, once you own it, you will find it extremely worthwhile your investment and time reading and analyzing our reports. We know the Chinese satellite broadband industry that is undergoing drastic change right now. And like many other industry sectors, if you do not follow up it well on timely manner, you will loose your chance and market. Remember, China is the world's largest broadband market therefore noone can afford to stay away from that market if he or she wants to be among the global players.</p>
      <p>See China_Satellite_Broadband_Reports_Month_Intro.pdf () for a quick view of how this report is designed. </p>
      <p>In additional to the textual reports (with options of accompanying media files such as pictures, audio and video files), we're also delivering the socalled China Satellite Broadband Databases (CSBD), which is presented as a form of MySQL databases as well as sectional presentations in pdf (R&amp;D, designers,manufacturers, key equpment suppliers, operators and solution and service providers, key investors and traders etc), with all necessary details for your further studies and contacts. </p>
